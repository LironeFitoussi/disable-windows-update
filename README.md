# Windows Update Disabler

A robust Python-based tool to disable Windows automatic updates through service management and registry modifications.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK:** This tool disables Windows automatic updates, which may prevent important security updates from being installed. Only use this if you understand the implications and plan to manually manage updates.

## üìã Features

- **Service Management**: Stops and disables the Windows Update service (`wuauserv`)
- **Registry Policies**: Sets system policies to prevent automatic updates
- **Auto Python Installation**: Automatically installs Python if not present
- **Administrator Privilege Check**: Ensures script runs with required permissions
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Robust error checking and user feedback
- **Cross-Platform Safety**: Prevents execution on non-Windows systems

## üìÅ Files Overview

- `disable_windows_update.py` - Main Python script that performs the update disabling
- `run_disable_script.bat` - Windows batch launcher with Python auto-installation
- `install_python.ps1` - PowerShell script for automatic Python installation
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies (currently empty - no external deps needed)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Method 1: Using the Batch Launcher (Recommended)
1. Download all files to a folder
2. Right-click on `run_disable_script.bat`
3. Select "Run as administrator"
4. Follow the on-screen prompts

### Method 2: Direct Python Execution
1. Ensure Python is installed
2. Right-click Command Prompt and "Run as administrator"
3. Navigate to the script directory
4. Run: `python disable_windows_update.py`

## üîß System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 7/8/10/11
- **Python**: 3.7+ (automatically installed if missing)
- **Privileges**: Administrator/elevated privileges required
- **Internet**: Required for Python auto-installation (if needed)

## üìñ Detailed Usage

### What the Script Does

1. **Platform Check**: Verifies the script is running on Windows
2. **Admin Check**: Ensures administrator privileges are present
3. **Service Disable**: Stops and disables the `wuauserv` (Windows Update) service
4. **Registry Modification**: Sets the following registry keys:
   - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU\NoAutoUpdate = 1`
   - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU\AUOptions = 1`

### Command Line Options

The Python script currently doesn't accept command-line arguments, but you can run it directly:

```bash
# Run with Python (requires admin privileges)
python disable_windows_update.py
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Registry Keys Modified

| Key | Value | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| `NoAutoUpdate` | `1` | Disables automatic update checking |
| `AUOptions` | `1` | Sets update option to "Never check for updates" |

### Services Modified

- **wuauserv** (Windows Update Service) - Stopped and set to disabled

## üîí Security Considerations

- Script requires administrator privileges to modify system settings
- Registry modifications affect system-wide update behavior
- Service changes persist until manually reversed
- Disabling updates may leave system vulnerable to security threats

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Permission denied" errors:**
- Ensure you're running as Administrator
- Check if antivirus is blocking the script

**"Python not found" errors:**
- Run the batch launcher which auto-installs Python
- Or manually install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org)

**Script doesn't run:**
- Verify all files are in the same directory
- Check Windows execution policy for PowerShell scripts

### Error Messages

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `This script must be run as administrator` | Right-click and "Run as administrator" |
| `This script only works on Windows systems` | Only run on Windows machines |
| `Permission denied while writing to registry` | Ensure admin privileges and check antivirus |
| `Python installation failed` | Install Python manually or check internet connection |

## üîÑ Reversing Changes

To re-enable Windows Updates, you need to manually:

1. **Re-enable the service:**
   ```cmd
   sc config wuauserv start= auto
   sc start wuauserv
   ```

2. **Remove registry keys:**
   - Navigate to `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU`
   - Delete `NoAutoUpdate` and `AUOptions` values
   - Or delete the entire `AU` key

3. **Alternative:** Use Windows Settings ‚Üí Update & Security ‚Üí Windows Update
